So we located the file that needs changing to be AutomataTheory.py

Here we can decide to either create a draw function for the DFAfromNFA class
Or we can implement a draw function for the Automata class allowing us to 
draw for both DFA and NFA

First step we will need to figure out exactly how the states are given and represented in the program
Then we will have to learn how to use NetworkX to draw this graph
Then we just have to plug it into out GUI and boom we are done
